## System Demonstration
Watch the system breakdown and demonstration on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0nDSXOgDVQ).

## ROS code
ROS src files for the host PC and raspberry pi have been left in the 
structure of their orginal src files.

All implemented files can be found in the "scripts" folder of each package.

ROS melodic was used for both the PC and pi.

All scripts run on python3, unless otherwise stated.

## Arduino Source Code
The code for the arduino is given the "arduino_sensor_manager_code" file

Integration of code from 3rd parties is stated explicitly at the top of each 
file and referenced accordingly.
